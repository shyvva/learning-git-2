                <p>So, so you think you can tell
                    Heaven from Hell,
                    Blue skies from pain.
                    Can you tell a green field
                    From a cold steel rail?
                    A smile from a veil?
                    Do you think you can tell?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Did they get you to trade
                    Your heroes for ghosts?
                    Hot ashes for trees?
                    Hot air for a cool breeze?
                    Cold comfort for change?
                    Did you exchange
                    A walk on part in the war,
                    For a lead role in a cage?
                </p>
                <p>
                    How I wish, how I wish you were here.
                    We're just two lost souls
                    Swimming in a fish bowl,
                    Year after year,
                    Running over the same old ground.
                    What have we found
                    The same old fears.
                    Wish you were here.
